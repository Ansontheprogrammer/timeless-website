#  #100DaysOfCode

I have decided to use this project to complete my #100daysofcodechallenge.

# Goal

I wanted to use a technology that I have not used before and I thought Flutter Web would be perfect. I have experience with Flutter but Flutter Web seemed very interesting to me and I would love to be competent with using it prior to it being released for production. I'm personally a big fan of many google technologies however this one takes the cake. I could only dream of creating a mobile app that is responsive in the browser. Maybe it's to ambitious but we can try right :-). Depending on the success of this project I may expand this website to also being optimized on a desktop application and mobile application.

## Bonus

Use some conditional logic to have the website also build as a mobile application. This should include many standard things for mobile applications such as App bars, snack bars, etc.
